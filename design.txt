modified version of galaga to reduce the complexity of having mobile enemies that attack the player
enemies are instead destructible asteroids and indestructible turrets
player controls a ship
    - ship has 5(?) health
    - ship has light cannons
    - ship has four missiles that are replenished with pickups
    - cannons do not automatically destroy all asteroids
    - missiles destroy all asteroids and (maybe) temporarily disable turrets
asteroids fall down the screen
    - all asteroids fall at the same rate, regardless of size
    - asteroids come in three different sizes, corresponding to health
        - small - 1 health
        - medium - 3 health
        - large - 5 health
turrets shoot at the player
    - turrets cannot be destroyed, only (maybe) disabled temporarily
    - turrets are rarer than asteroids
    - at certain time intervals the turret fires at the player's current location
    - turrets spawn more commonly at higher levels, up to a cap
at certain time intervals, the player gains points
at certain point thresholds, the player regains 1 health, capped
at larger intervals, the player is set back to full health
at smaller intervals than the health the asteroids get faster
every so many asteroid intervals the turrets will shoot faster

high score is stored, potentially even when the game is closed
